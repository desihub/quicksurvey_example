Here is where the outputs will be stored.

For this example there will be eight directories
created, one for each epoch, numbered from `0` to `7`.
Inside each directory you will find the files

* `zcat.fits`. Redshift catalog at the end of that epoch.
* `mtl.fits`. Merged target list at the beginning of that epoch.

and the directory `fiberassign` with all the `fibermap` files 
result of fiber assignment.
